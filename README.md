# Reproducing regional gravimetric analysis of Africa from GOCE data

This is a reproduction of the results presented in Braitenberg (2015).

See the notebooks on
[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/leouieda/africa-gravity/tree/master/).

Gravity and topography data were downloaded from the [ICGEM
webservice](http://icgem.gfz-potsdam.de/).
